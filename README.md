## 🚀 Quick Start

### Basic Installation

```bash
# Install all dependencies (includes AI and development tools)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install system dependencies (macOS with Homebrew)
brew install --cask libreoffice

# Install system dependencies (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt-get install libreoffice
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from documents_processor import Document

# Process a single document with AI image descriptions
doc = Document("path/to/your/document.pdf")
doc.process()

print("Extracted text:", doc.text_content)
print("Found images:", doc.images)  # Saved to images/ with unique names
print("Extracted tables:", doc.tables)  # Saved to tables/ as CSV files
```

### Business Document Processing Workflow

```bash
# Step 1: Process document package (receipts, tickets, invoices)
python process_all_to_markdown.py --input business_trip_docs/

# Step 2: Extract structured business data
python structured_report_processor.py --schema expense_report_schema.json

# Result: Consolidated expense report with totals, categories, dates
```

#### Business Trip Expense Analysis Example:
```python
from structured_report_processor import StructuredReportProcessor

# Configure for expense extraction
processor = StructuredReportProcessor(
    schema="expense_report_schema.json",
    prompt="expense_extraction_prompt"
)

# Process business trip document collection
results = processor.process_report("processed_documents/business_trip_report.md")

# Results include:
# - Total expenses by category (transport, accommodation, meals)
# - Timeline of expenses with dates and locations  
# - Vendor information and payment methods
# - Tax-deductible vs personal expenses
# - Currency conversions and exchange rates
```

### Mass Processing for RAG Systems

```python
from documents_processor import batch_process_folder

# Process entire document collection for RAG system
results = batch_process_folder(
    input_folder="documents/",
    output_file="knowledge_base.md"  # Structured for LLM processing
)
```

### Professional Cleanup Management

```bash
# Interactive cleanup with safety features
python cleanup_utility.py

# Preview what would be cleaned
python cleanup_utility.py --preview

# Automatic cleanup with backup
python cleanup_utility.py --all --backup
```
